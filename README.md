## Overview
We are proud to announce that **Cybernetic Defenders** won **2nd place** in the **CyberHack4AI Hackathon**, held at **Sapienza University of Rome** from **October 1 to 3, 2024**. The hackathon challenged participants to develop innovative solutions using **AI** and **cybersecurity** techniques to solve real-world problems. 

Our project, **StudentBridge**, was designed to address the struggles international students face when moving to Italy, especially with housing, legal documentation, and university processes. The solution provides an AI-driven platform with an embedded chatbot that centralizes critical information and resources for students, making their transition smoother.

For more details, you can find our final presentation in the repository, titled `StudentBridge Project`.

## Project Goal
Our team, **Cybernetic Defenders**, tackled the **AI for Students and Teachers** challenge. We built **StudentBridge**, an AI-powered information hub aimed at solving the common issues faced by international students when moving to Italy. The system focuses on assisting students with bureaucratic processes, housing, legal documentation, and university applications.

Inspired by the French platform "Campus France," **StudentBridge** is an all-in-one portal offering centralized guidance through a web platform and a chatbot, which helps students in their native language. Key features include:
- Information on housing, legal documentation, and university procedures.
- Regular updates and frequently asked questions.
- Partnerships with local businesses offering targeted services, such as banks and housing agencies.

## How it Works
**StudentBridge** acts as a comprehensive digital assistant for students, offering personalized responses to inquiries about accommodation, legal requirements, and university procedures. The platform is powered by AI models that enable:
- Real-time updates on relevant deadlines and information.
- Multilingual support to cater to international students.
- Partnerships with local businesses to provide targeted services (e.g., banking and housing).

## Features
- Centralized information hub for international students.
